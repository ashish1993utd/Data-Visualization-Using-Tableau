# Visualization-Using-Tableau

Ever wondered the reason behind the gigantic box office collection of movies which inevitably decides a movie's success? Is it because of the stars which attaract crowd of millions to the cinema halls and multiplexes or is it because of the director who's movie is always on your waitlist? Does the social media campaign of a movie , which has been trending for quite a while now, effects its Earnings. I always had these kind of thoughts crossing my head, so I decided to dig down further into data and get the answers
