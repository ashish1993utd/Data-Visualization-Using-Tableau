Below are the insights drawn from the Analysis and Visualizations that I made.

It is not necessary that the movie that has spent the most money or had the largest budget, is a successful movie.

Budget doesn't really matter much when it comes to earning gross/profit.

Imdb score does matter in case of gross but not that much, we can see movies with highest imdb rating like shawashank redemption have lesser earnings than movies
with low imdb ratings.

Actor popularity does affect the movie earnings, avatar or some other movies might be an exception to it, because of the director maybe.

While analyzing impact of social media campaign on movies, we can tell, darker the color, higher the facebook likes.
Multistarrer movies have darker colors due to more number of popular actors-- for example Avengers (quite dark)

Analyzing director's likes-dark knight gets darker doing this. We can tell Nolan movies are really awaited.
we can figure out the popular directors this way, also it's gross is quite high , so we can say likes of a director also determines the gross income,
beacuse people have heard of the director and they believe it's going to be good movie if this person has directed it.
